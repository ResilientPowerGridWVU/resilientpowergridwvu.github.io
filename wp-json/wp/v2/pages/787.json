The algorithm formulation is based on the concept that in the vicinity of collapse the major chunk of power from sending end is consumed by losses such that near collapse point there is negligible change in apparent power at receiving end. The authors further use this concept to come up with a protection algorithm which is implementable in a numeric relay.

Load models comprising of ZIP coefficients and Dynamic models are utilized to study the impact on voltage stability assessment in smart grid. Impact of load models on accuracy of various voltage stability indices is analyzed.

Existing models for the HVDC interconnections, that are based on voltage source converters are evaluated for their suitability with Thevenin based voltage stability analysis.
